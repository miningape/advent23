# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions to this year's advent of code.

### How do I run this?

1. Create a plaintext (utf-8) file containing exactly the problem input (for this example I will call it `problem.input`)
2. Using the `cargo run` utility
   1. pass path of the day/problem via the `--manifest-path` flag
   2. pass the path to the problem input

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path day1/problem1/Cargo.toml problem.input
```
